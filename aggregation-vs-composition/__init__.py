Aggregation vs Composition

Aggregation and Composition are two types of association relationships between two objects in object-oriented programming.

Aggregation is a weak association. 
It is a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. 
It is denoted using a 'has-a' relationship.

Examples:
A car has an engine. But the engine can exist independently of the car.
A company has employees. But the employees can exist independently of the company.
Uber has drivers. But the drivers can exist independently of Uber.
Zomato has restaurants. But the restaurants can exist independently of Zomato.
Netflix has movies. But the movies can exist independently of Netflix.

Composition is a strong association.
It is a relationship where the child cannot exist independently of the parent.
It is denoted using a 'contains-a' relationship.

Examples:
A house has rooms. The rooms cannot exist independently of the house.
A book has chapters. The chapters cannot exist independently of the book.
A Tree has leaves. The leaves cannot exist independently of the tree.
